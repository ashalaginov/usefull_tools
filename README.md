# Useful tools

From time to time I have interesting tasks in automated files processing. Here I will share a few interesting and tricky scipts that might be useful for other people too. 

# One-line functions

- bash_useful.txt - everything that you can execute in Linux terminal
- mysql_useful.txt - MySQL tricks and fixes, especailly with large-scale datasets

# Stand-alone scripts

- md5_extension_rename.sh - iteratively renames files in the 'tmp' folder to the format "md5.extension" idependently form data type of rile format
- XlsxToCSV.sh - converts all Microsoft Office *.xlsx files in the directory to *.csv using libreoffice headless, then removes *.xlsx
- country_domain_extension.php - prints country, domain name and extension of top-level domain name. You have to install GeoIP for PHP.
